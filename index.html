			<h2>Encore Ticket Information</h2>
			<p>There are several different options to consider when purchasing tickets for Encore performances. Season Tickets are available for purchase from August through October each season and provide our patrons with the best value. A set of Season Tickets consists of one ticket to each of the eight Encoure Series performances. Individual Show Tickets can also be purchased prior to each performance; on sale date varies for each show, but are usually on sale approximately two weeks prior to the performance. Specialty packages vary from year to year but may also be offered throughout the season.</p>
